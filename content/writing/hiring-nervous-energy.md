We were a quiet team. We tended to internalize our nervous energy.

And then we hired Terri. Terri was the opposite. When nervous, Terri would seemingly summon more energy and begin to externalize it.

This led to more team collaboration. More open and honest discussion. More conversations about _feelings_. More pairing. More comfort.

And most importantly, more trust. It led to us knowing each other better, knowing how the other might be feeling in a certain situation, and addressing that in the appropriate way. It led to us starting to fill in the blanks for one another. It led to us learning from one another, no matter what level of seniority. It led to us tearing down knowledge silos, because Terri would feel nervous when she didn't know what we were talking about, and would start asking a lot of questions - we'd be forced to walk her through the work and explain things. It led to more team bonding - team outings, team lunches, etc. - and they didn't feel forced in that awful way they often do.

When hiring, consider diversity in your team's energy. It's had an overwhelmingly positive on our team.
