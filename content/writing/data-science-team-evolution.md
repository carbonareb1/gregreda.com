Mature Company

Starts out as one person with some programming, quant, and data chops. They do all sorts of things -- basic analysis (didn't know how much money we were giving away),

Other departments might hire a person do be an analyst for them.

Eventually that person might realize they can't scale, so they build some tooling around it. Customer Dashboard. Nightly ETL pipeline for first "warehouse." Teaches everyone enough SQL so that they can tweak the queries that Data Scientist has written for them -- changing dates, field names, adding a new aggregate function.

Data Person #1 gets buried in work, a couple more data people are hired, maybe #1 becomes the "lead" and, directly or indirectly, starts managing the new data people. They're now a small team.

An implicition decision is being made as this small team starts forming -- that data science is a functional organization -- that is should be centralized so as to best serve the needs of the rest of the organization.k

It's quite likely that this makes sense, but because the decision is implicit, it's likely that tradeoffs and goals are not considered.

Team grows, hires some engineers and analysts, is centralized.

Then leader of that team realizes they can't be single funnel into work for the team -- stressful and means that other needs don't get met, or that team is too disconnected from their stakeholders, be it product managers, sales, marketing, etc.

Team then decides to embedded individuals into other departments or groups -- effectively making them a partner or point of contact for the needs of that department. The single point of failure has been removed and the data person and stakeholders are able to work freely and prioritize on their own (with input and support from the data manager). This scales more.

Functional vs Mission Driven
Centralized vs Decentralized
Squad vs Chapter
