Title: Hello World

So I finally got around to putting something of my own up.

My intentions are mainly to use this space as a way to document mini projects that I'm working on, so plan on it being pretty programming, data, visualization, and statistics heavy - I get bored if I'm not learning something new or doing something I find challenging.  That said, I'm known to go on tangents about music and beer (and whatever else I feel like ranting about at the time).

There's also a high likelihood that I'll constantly be tweaking the layout of the site - hopefully the four people reading won't mind.
