Pair ~programming~ analysis.

Pair programming for engineering too focused on learning a specific concept, API, section of the code base, etc. It can also be too focused on implementing a particular thing in a more bug-free way, or troubleshooting a thorny code problem together -- more eyeballs.

While data science is similar to engineering, it is also just different enough such that many software engineering best practices do not cleanly translate. Pair programming is one of them.


At Sprout, our data science team has had a lot of success "blitzing" on problems -- meeting for an inital brainstorm about the problem at hand, everyone going off on their own and trying an approach, and then coming back together and regrouping on what we've learned.

However, blitzing is expensive from a time and resource perspective. It also creates a temporary blackhole for other projects that are not being blitzed on. Further, it can run the risk of bad feelings and wasted effort -- someone will have spent a week or two spiking on something that might be entirely thrown away, or their approach might not be picked as the final solution for a variety of reasons.

In hopes of realizing the benefits of blitzing while also mitigating its downsides, we've started pairing on problems that might not be typically paired on -- "pair analysis."

Similar to pair programming, one person is the driver while the other is the navigator. Though with pair analysis, the driver might more abtly be called the plotter or analyzer, while the the other might be called the inquisitor, thinking aloud about what they're seeing in the data, asking more questions to dig into, and formulating hypotheses.

We've just begun scratching the surface, but we've found the following:
- { What are some things we've learned }
- { What are some benefits we've realized }
- { What are some of the assumptions we had going in that were wrong}
- { How have we been surprised }
- { What are some downsides we didn't expect and how have we tried to fix them }
