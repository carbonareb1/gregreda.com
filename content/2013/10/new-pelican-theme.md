I spent some time last weekend making minor changes to this site. Specifically:

1. New typography - headers are [Droid Serif](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Serif), while everything else is [Droid Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans). Fonts are also a bit bigger (I think it's easier to read).
2. Added [Jake Vanderplas'](http://jakevdp.github.io/) [liquid tags plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/liquid_tags) for Pelican, which allows for easy embedding of [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

I plan on continuing to tweak things over time, but I'm pretty happy with the way it looks right now.

[Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/gjreda/notebook-simpler) and feel free to use it. It's mobile-friendly, too.
