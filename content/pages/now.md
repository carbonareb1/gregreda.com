## Reading
I'm currently reading [Our Band Could Be Your Life](http://amzn.to/2Ctxwqg), which chronicles about 13 punk, post-punk, and alternative bands spanning 1981-1991. It's been great so far.

I recently finished [The Rider](http://amzn.to/2CRVCw0), a novel weaving in and out of author Tim Krabb√©'s inner monologue during a road bicycling race in the mountains of France. The book has long been a cycling classic and was fairly recently translated to English.

I first heard about the book through [this article](https://www.bicycling.com/culture/think-you-understand-the-rider-think-again) on Bicycling.com and immediately knew I had to read it. It was thoroughly enjoyable -- a must-read for any cyclist or fan of the sport.

## Listening
Lots and lots of **70s, 80s, and 90s punk, post-punk, and alternative** (hence why I'm reading the book above). Some albums I've _really_ enjoyed from this segment:

- Wire - Pink Flag
- Gang of Four - Entertainment
- Mission of Burma - Signals, Calls and Marches
- Mission of Burma - vs.
- Minutemen - Double Nickels On The Dime
- The Replacements - Let It Be
- The Replacements - Tim
- Sleater-Kinney - Dig Me Out
- Fugazi - 13 Songs
- The Buzzcocks - Singles Going Steady
- X - More Fun in the New World
- New Order - ... Pretty much their entire discography

I grew up listening to punk and emo bands, so much of my musical exploration over the last five years has been around how the genres (and nearby ones) came to be. While teenage me could have liked some better bands, the origins and evolution of punk and post-punk are things I really enjoy.

Prior to my current punk and post-punk streak, I was on a bit of an 80s and 90s shoegaze and grunge bender. And then some classic jazz before that.

## Watching
My wife and I recently finished [The Leftovers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2699128/). I was not a fan.

[Rick and Morty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is one of my favorite shows still going (along with [Game of Thrones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=nv_sr_1), of course). [Suits](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is a great guilty pleasure.

Some movies I've enjoyed recently:

- [Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5027774/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
- [12 Angry Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
- [Dope](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3850214/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
