## Reading
I'm currently reading [Our Band Could Be Your Life](http://amzn.to/2Ctxwqg), which chronicles about 13 punk, post-punk, and alternative bands spanning 1981-1991. It's been great so far.

I recently finished [The Rider](http://amzn.to/2CRVCw0), a novel weaving in and out of author Tim Krabb√©'s inner monologue during a road bicycling race in the mountains of France. The book has long been a cycling classic and was fairly recently translated to English.

I first heard about the book through [this article](https://www.bicycling.com/culture/think-you-understand-the-rider-think-again) on Bicycling.com and immediately knew I had to read it. It was thoroughly enjoyable - a must-read for any cyclist or fan of the sport.

## Listening
Lots and lots of **70s, 80s, and 90s punk, post-punk, and alternative** (hence why I'm reading the book above). Some albums I've _really_ enjoyed from this segment:

- Wire - Pink Flag
- Gang of Four - Entertainment
- Mission of Burma - Signals, Calls and Marches
- Mission of Burma - vs.
- Minutemen - Double Nickels On The Dime
- The Replacements - Let It Be
- The Replacements - Tim
- Sleater-Kinney - Dig Me Out
- Fugazi - 13 Songs
- The Buzzcocks - Singles Going Steady

The period + genre of music above is probably my favorite combination - I could go on and on about it.

## Watching
My wife and I recently finished [The Leftovers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2699128/). I was not a fan.

Some movies I've enjoyed recently:

- [Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5027774/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
- [12 Angry Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
- [Dope](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3850214/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
