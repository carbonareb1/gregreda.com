Hi! I'm Greg Reda, a data scientist and software engineer based in San Francisco. I'm currently a machine learning engineer at [Instacart](https://inst.cr/t/wqze6Gpuz).

I enjoy using data, statistics, and machine learning to help companies create great products and drive strategy. I also enjoy building and leading data science teams, having done so at both [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com) and [GrubHub](https://grubhub.com).

Much of my free time is spent hiking and cycling the Bay Area, as well as listening to all sorts of punk, rock, synth, and jazz music.

I'm a proud Chicagoan, having grown up and spent most of my life there.

I don't check my Twitter much, but you can email me at gjreda at gmail.
