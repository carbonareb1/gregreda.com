Title: About

Iâ€™m a Chicago-based data scientist and developer at [Sprout Social](http://www.sproutsocial.com), where I'm currently the Director of Data Science.

Previously, I was the first data science hire at [GrubHub](http://www.grubhub.com/), where I led the team focused on data research, A/B testing, and product analytics.

I've also spent time at [Datascope](http://datascopeanalytics.com/), where I helped an NBA team with draft preparation and scouting, and [PwC](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/index.jhtml), where I focused on analytics related to fraud, investigations, and litigation.
