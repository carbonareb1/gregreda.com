## Hello 

Hi, I’m Greg, a human being living in San Francisco with my spouse and son.

By trade, I've been a software engineer and data scientist, typically working at the intersection of engineering, machine learning, and product. I’ve been an individual contributor and have managed engineering teams at companies like [Instacart](https://instacart.com/), [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/), and [Grubhub](https://www.grubhub.com/).

I've also spent time advising an NBA team on game prep and player evaluation, a growth stage company on estimating customer lifetime value, and a public company on building data products.

You can find my resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJpdKFyDNzT4Hs2Ml7XjIBzmSDFSZTT_cFNYp4sPB3w/edit). I enjoy being a generalist working across a variety of engineering and data roles.

Outside of work, I'm a runner, pizza maker, and music lover. I'm partial to [Chicago thin-crust](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/dining/tavern-thin-crust-pizza-chicago.html), the true Chicago style pizza, and I sometimes daydream of owning and running a small pizza shop.
