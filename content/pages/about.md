I'm a freelance data scientist, developer, and occassional writer living in Chicago.

Previously, I was the first data hire at [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/), 
where I led the data team for three years. 
I've also worked at [Datascope](http://www.datascopeanalytics.com) 
and [PwC](http://www.pwc.com).

I'd love to work together. [Get in touch](mailto:greg@gregreda.com?subject=Work).
