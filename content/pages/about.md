Hi! I'm Greg Reda, a data scientist and software engineer in San Francisco, where I'm a machine learning engineer at [Instacart](https://instacart.com).

I use data, statistics, and machine learning to help companies create great products and drive strategy. I also enjoy building and leading data science teams, having done so at both [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com) and [GrubHub](https://grubhub.com).

I've spent time at [Datascope](http://datascopeanalytics.com/), where I
helped an NBA team with draft prep and scouting, and
[PwC](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/index.jhtml), where I focused on analytics
related to fraud, investigations, and litigation.

I spend much of my free time hiking and cycling the Bay Area and listening to all sorts of punk, rock, synth, and jazz music.

I'm a proud Chicagoan, having grown up and spent most of my life there.
