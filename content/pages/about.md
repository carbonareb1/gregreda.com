Hi! I'm Greg Reda, a data scientist and developer living in San Francisco.

I dig using data, statistics, and machine learning to create great products and drive strategy. I enjoy building and leading data science teams, having done so at both Sprout Social and GrubHub.

At [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com), I was the Director of Data Science, where I built and led a team of seven data scientists, analysts, and engineers. Our team was responsible for features like [Content Suggestions](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/content-suggestions/), [Sentiment Analysis](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/sprout-social-customer-sentiment/), and [ViralPost](https://sproutsocial.com/features/viralpost/). We also built and maintained internal data infrastructure, creating data pipelines, developing metrics, and building tools to analyze product usage.

At [GrubHub](https://grubhub.com), I was the first data science hire and later led a small team responsible for data research, experimentation, and product analytics.

I've also spent time at [Datascope](http://datascopeanalytics.com/), where I
helped an NBA team with draft prep and scouting, and
[PwC](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/index.jhtml), where I focused on analytics
related to fraud, investigations, and litigation.

I'm a graduate of [Marquette University](https://marquette.edu) where I studied
economics, information technology, and business. Yes, I'm a big Marquette
basketball fan.

I'm an avid baseball fan, rooting for those once [lovable <strike>losers</strike> winners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs).

I spend much of my free time cycling the Bay Area and listening to all sorts of punk, rock, synth, and jazz music.

I'm a lifelong and tremendously proud Chicagoan.
