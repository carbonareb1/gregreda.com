Hi! I'm Greg Reda, a data scientist and software engineer based in San Francisco.

I use data, statistics, and machine learning to help companies create great products and drive strategy. I also enjoy building and leading data science teams, having done so at both [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com) and [GrubHub](https://grubhub.com).

I spend much of my free time hiking and cycling the Bay Area and listening to all sorts of punk, rock, synth, and jazz music.

I'm a proud Chicagoan, having grown up and spent most of my life there.

You can reach me at gjreda at gmail.
