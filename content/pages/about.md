## Hello 

Hi, I’m Greg, a human being living in [Wilmette, IL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmette,_Illinois) with my spouse and two sons.

By profession, I've been a software engineer and data scientist, typically working at the intersection of engineering, machine learning, and product. I’ve been an individual contributor and have managed engineering teams at companies like [Instacart](https://instacart.com/), [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/), and [Grubhub](https://www.grubhub.com/).

On occassion, I also take on consulting projects. Some past projects include advising an NBA team on game prep and player evaluation, building customer LTV models for a growth stage startup, and, most recently, building the backend for an [AI-assisted writing application](https://github.com/refstudio/refstudio).

I enjoy being a generalist working across a variety of engineering and data roles. If you're interested in my resume, you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJpdKFyDNzT4Hs2Ml7XjIBzmSDFSZTT_cFNYp4sPB3w/edit).

Outside of work, I'm a runner, pizza maker, and music lover. I'm partial to [Chicago thin-crust](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/dining/tavern-thin-crust-pizza-chicago.html), the true Chicago style pizza, and I sometimes daydream of owning and running a small pizza shop.
